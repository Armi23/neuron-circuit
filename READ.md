Final Project for Applied Math 115: Mathematical Modeling

This program makes random neuronal circuits based on Kleene's simple model. 

Use run_neuron to input a size, threshold, and number of runs you want. Each run will generate a new circuit.

Comments pending end of finals period (sorry for the bad practice).
